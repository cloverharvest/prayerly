### What is Prayerly

Link to Prayerly: http://stormy-beach-45228.herokuapp.com/

This is a prayer app built on Rails.

An anonymous user can go to the site, lookup a prayer via a search form or dropdown filter. He or she can also add a prayer intentions via an individual prayer.

An admin, on the other hand, is able to full crud prayers; edit and delete comments; and add prayer categories.

While most of the prayers are in the Christian/Catholic discipline, this app is modular and can be used to build prayer applications of different faiths.

It is the builder's intent and purpose that this contributes well to open source and that this would also serve as a spiritual encouragement for programmers and believers, alike.

Credit goes to EWTN, catholiconline.com, praymorenovenas.com, gratefulness.com for the direction and inspiration with regard to content.

She would also like to thank her instructors Juliana, Justin, Nathan and D-i-R Nick at General Assembly for teaching her the fine art and science of web development.
