### What is Prayerly

This is a prayer app built on Rails.

While most of the prayers are in the Christian/Catholic discipline, this app is modular and can be used to build a prayer application ecumenically.

It is the builder's intent that this serves as encouragement for coders and believers alike.

Credit goes to EWTN, catholiconline.com, praymorenovenas.com, gratefulness.com for the right direction and inspiration with regard to content.
